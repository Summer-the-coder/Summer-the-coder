- Hello there.
- I am Summer-the-coder, although I usually go by simply "Summer".
- I have quite good knowledge of JS (although only the clientside part for now) and Python. Looking forward to learn C# (mostly for Unity), and, after that, I plan to dive into how computers work on the lower level, and, therefore, learn C and C++.
- My dream is to become a gamedev at some point in the future. 
- Here be dragons...
